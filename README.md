# Sorting Algorithms for Integer Arrays

We implement 3 sorting algorithms for int arrays

## Bubble Sort

The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts the array in ascending order.

The algorithm is implemented in C.

## Radix Sort

I implemented Radix Sort by Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V'ing the information from ocw.cs.pub.ro.
